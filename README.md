========================================================
The purpose of this project [within Johns Hopkins course "Getting and Cleaning Data"] is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.[1] 

### Raw Data
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones [2] is the idea behind the data collected and provided. Unzip the file [3] into your working directory

### Transformation
Start the clean up process by running "run_analysis.R""

### Tidy Dataset 
The clean data set created in the step above is called "tidy.txt" and contains 1 record per subject and activity, 180 rows and 66 variables, described in its Code Book [4]
